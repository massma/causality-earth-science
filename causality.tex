\begin{abstract}
  Research on the inference of causal effects from data is rapidly
  intensifying, and earth system scientists are applying new causal
  inference methods to a variety of problems. I examine the
  theoretical justification for applying causal inference methods to
  climate science. Because we generally do not fully observe the state
  space of the problem, the assumptions behind generic causal
  inference methods break down. However, by focusing on problems at
  the human-environment interface (e.g. anthropogenic greenhouse gas
  emissions and urban heat island effect), we may be able to
  successfully apply causal inference methods to earth science and
  calculate the causal effects of humans on the environment.
