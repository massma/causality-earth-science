* Reproduce the manuscript "Causal Inference in Earth Science" by Adam Massmann, Pierre Gentine, and Jakob Runge

* Required software

   - [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][texlive]] (tested on 2019)
  -  [[https://www.haskell.org/downloads/#minimal][Haskell GHC compiler and Cabal build tool]]
   - [[https://www.graphviz.org/][Graphviz]]
   - [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][gnuplot]]
   - [[https://www.ghostscript.com/][ghostscript]]

* Build instructions
** Windows (untested)

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   cabal v2-run build
   #+END_SRC

** GNU/Linux instructions

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   cabal v2-run build
   #+END_SRC

   or, with GNU Make:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make
   #+END_SRC

   This should also probably work on OSX, but I haven't tested it.

* Directory structure
  ~doc/~ contains the paper, ~src/~ contains haskell code for
  generating data and figures.
