* Reproduce the manuscript "Causal Inference in Earth Science" by Adam Massmann

* Required software

   - [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][texlive]] (tested on 2019)
   - [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][Haskell Stack]]
   - [[https://www.graphviz.org/][Graphviz]]

* Build instructions
** Windows (untested)

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack build && stack exec build
   #+END_SRC

** GNU/Linux instructions

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack build && stack exec build
   #+END_SRC

   or, with GNU Make:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 make
   #+END_SRC

   This should also probably work on OSX, but I haven't tested it.
