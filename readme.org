* Reproduce the manuscript "Causal Inference in Earth Science" by Adam Massmann

** Requirements

   - [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][texlive]] (tested on 2019)
   - [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][Haskell Stack]]
   - [[https://shakebuild.com/][Shake]] (installable with Stack)
   - [[https://www.graphviz.org/][Graphviz]]

** Windows instructions (untested)

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack exec ./build.bat
#+END_SRC

** GNU/Linux instructions

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack exec ./build.sh
#+END_SRC

   This should also probably work on OSX, but I haven't tested it.
